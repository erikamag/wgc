maize-sorghum comparison
================

## Method

Coding sequence data for primary transcripts of each annotated gene in the genome assemblies of eight grass species, including maize and sorghum used in the analysis, were obtained from Phytozome [ref]. Similar sequences were identified using BLASTP [ref], requiring an alignment spanning at least 50% of total sequence length and --cscore=0.7 [ref]. BLASTP output used to run QuotaAlign [ref] with additional parameters -tandem Nmax=20, -cscore=0.7 and -quota set to 1:2 between sorghum and maize.

## Result

* [Whole genome dotplot](../data/21_Sbicolor_B73/01.pdf)
* [Fractionation of the two maize subgenomes](../data/21_Sbicolor_B73/04.retained.maize.pdf)
* [list of maize genes in the two subgenomes]
